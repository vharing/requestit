			<div class="row">
				<h5>How can Request it! help library staff manage materials requests?</h5>
				<p>The Request it! application integrates a robust database system to organize and store requests received from patrons.

				<h5>Why should my library use Request it! ?</h5>
				<p>Request it! is a tool designed to enable staff members to handle requests with more precision and increased efficiency. Most libraries have been effected by shrinking budgets, competing capital requests, and limits of staff growth. Request it! empowers libraries, both large and small, to increase their level of customer service without added costs. Each benefit is made possible by offering Request it! for free.</p>

				<h5>How can patrons submit a request?</h5>
				<p>Patrons access a public facing web form and enter personal information, pickup locations, as well as item request details. While this form can be customized, it is recommended developers institute changes to ensure compatibility with the application interface. After submitting a request, the patron receives a message immediately acknowledging the requests' receipt.</p>

				<h5>Where should the the patron request be located?</h5>
				<p>The location of the request form is completely up to you. However, patrons are more likely to use the form, and consequently use your library, if the form is easy to access. Placing the request form behind a password protected page may discourage some users from using the service.</p>

				<h5>How can staff access the application?</h5>
				<p>The application is accessed using a modern web browser, which are available on all computers today. Request it! requires users provide username and password credentials to access the interface and use the database. This step is necesasry due to the confidentiality of patron records. Administrators are required to create, delete, and modify accounts. However, once a user account is created, users have access to retieve and set new passwords.</p>

				<h5>How can staff view and manage a request?</h5>
				<p>The most compelling aspect of Request it! is its ease of use. Navigation options are limited and plainly labeled. Users have the options of viewing all new requests, viewing pending requests, searching requests. Selected records are displayed in table format, providing a visually organized view. Simply clicking on the "Manage" button enables users to view request details, print a request order form, and correspond with the patron.</p>

				<h5>Can users access advanced search options?</h5>
				<p>Yes! By clicking on the search requests link, users will have immediately access to search records based on different criteria. Records can be searched by patron name, request id number, and can be filtered based on the pickup location and date of request.</p>
